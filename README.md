# Tetris Game

## Overview

This is a simple Tetris game implemented in C# using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game where players must manipulate falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks) to create complete rows without gaps. When a row is completely filled, it disappears, and the blocks above it move down by one row. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playfield.
